FGC_Data is the Data Gathering file to be used for this project

To use it visit start.gg and go to any tournament

Look at the url and copy everything after start.gg

Example: tournament/tnj-tuesday-44

This right here is known as the tournament slug

Run the file and enter that and the data gathering process will begin

CSVs are saved to current working directory
